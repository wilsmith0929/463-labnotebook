### HTML
For these exercises, I used the videos for help when needed, but I tried to do them on my own. I also used the videos to correct mistakes and make these exercises as examples for the homework assignments.
All of the exercises in this section were helpful. There wasn't one that stuck out as being more helpful, but they were helpful all in their own way.
