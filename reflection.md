## Reflection Document
Were you able to complete the exercises on your own or did you use the
videos or the solutions for help?
How helpful did you find the exercises in this section? Was there one
exercise that was particularly helpful?
Was there something that you wish had been explained better?
Were there other exercises that might have helped you learn this weekâ€™s
topic a little better?

### HTML
For these exercises, I used the videos for help when needed, but I tried to do them on my own. I also used the videos to correct mistakes and make these exercises as examples for the homework assignments.
All of the exercises in this section were helpful. There wasn't one that stuck out as being more helpful, but they were helpful all in their own way.
I don't recall having something explained here be confusing.
I don't think there are exercises to help learn a little better. HTML is pretty straight-forward.

### Accessibility
I ended up using the videos for help to get a sense of the material.
All of the exercises were helpful in this section. 
I don't know that anything could have been explained better here.
No other exercises.

### CSS
I used the videos for help in this section.
The exercises were pretty helpful, but there wasn't one that stuck out as being more helpful than the rest.
I wish stuff like padding and margins would have been explained better, they still don't make a ton of sense to me.
No other exercises.

### Flexbox
I used the videos for help in this section of the notebook.
The exercises were helpful, but again, not one particular one stuck out.
I wish some of the examples would have been explained better in a more general context instead of more focused on the specific exercise.
Different types of exercises of one topic to highlight different scenarios of an exercise.

### CSS-Grid
I used the videos for help.
All of the exercises were helpful, but also kind of confusing.
I didn't have a great understanding of the concept in general which I should go back and look at.
No other exercises would've helped.

### Bootstrap
Videos were used to help complete.
The exercises were helpful in understanding the coding parts.
Couldn't explain better.
No other exercises that I could think of.

### Javascript
Videos were used.
The exercises were quite helpful.
I wish the arrow functions were explained a bit better.
No other exercises.

### JQuery
Videos were used to help out.
Exercises were helpful.
Can't think of things needed to be explained better.
No other exercises.
